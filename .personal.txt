Objective:
    Create a DAO

    Steps:
        - Write the smart contracts ✅
        - Write deployment scripts ✅
        - Wite scripts to interact with them ✅

        Contracts vs Deploy Scripts vs Scripts:
        - Contracts contain the logic and data structures of the DApp and are written in Solidity.
        - Deployment scripts define the deployment process and are used to deploy contracts to the Ethereum network.
        - Scripts are standalone files used for interacting with deployed contracts and performing various tasks.

Setup:

    - `yarn add --dev hardhat`    // creates node_modules, package.json and yarn.lock files
    - `yarn hardhat`    empty hardhat.config.js    // creates hardhat.config.js
    - `yarn add --dev @openzeppelin/contracts`
    - `yarn add --dev prettier prettier-plugin-solidity`
    - `yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers`
    - `yarn add --dev hardhat-deploy`       // hardhat-deploy allows you to write deploy scripts in the deploy folder.
    - `yarn add fs`
    
Create:

    - "contracts" folder
        - "Box.sol" file
        - "GovernanceToken.sol" file
        - "governance_standard" folder
            - "GovernorContract.sol" file
            - "TimeLock.sol" file
    - ".gitignore" file
    - "deploy" folder
        - "01-deploy-governor-token.js" file
        - "02-deploy-time-lock.js" file
        - "03-deploy-governor-contract.js" file
        - "04-setup-governance-contract.js" file
        - "05-deploy-box.js" file
    - "helper-hardhat-config.js" file   // for TimeLock.sol & GovernorContract.sol constructor arguments which is going to be used a lot.
    - "scripts" folder
        - "propose.js" file
        - "vote.js" file
        - "queue-and-execute.js" file
    - "utils" folder
        - "move-blocks.js" file // To move blocks on local blockchain
        - "move-time.js" file
    - "proposals.json" file     // To keep track of all proposals


Notes:
    - Error prompt: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'JsonRpcProvider')
        Solution: `yarn add ethers@5.7.2`
    - Contracts vs Deploy Scripts vs Scripts:
        Contracts contain the logic and data structures of the DApp and are written in Solidity.
        Deployment scripts define the deployment process and are used to deploy contracts to the Ethereum network.
        Scripts are standalone files used for interacting with deployed contracts and performing various tasks.
    - After writing the deploy scripts; when we run `yanr hardhat node`, the node also deploys all of the contracts in the fake blockchain.
        This helps to run scripts to interact with the blockchain and test them out. 
    - After voting period ends, we can check the state of the proposal in console by running:
        - `yarn hardhat console --network localhost`
        - Paste the governor variable line: `const governor = await ethers.getContract("GovernorContract")` and press enter 
        - `await governor.state("20410873684195684007502903743313035195888380351590997192411449750453432545334")    // proposalId taken from "../proposals.json"
        - Outcome (0,1,2,3,4,5,6 or 7) can be matched with "ProposalState" in this interface: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/IGovernor.sol


Commands to run:
    - `yarn hardhat run .\scripts\propose.js --network localhost`   // check scripts on local blockchain

To-Do:
    - Script for auto-verification of "deploy" folder files
